# Sorting-Visualization
A pygame visualization of the most commonly taught sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, merge sort.
Which sort is being performed can be controlled by pressing the corresponding key.
The sorts are slowed down to allow visualization of the method, so they do not represent relative speed of the sorting algorithms.

# To Use
- Must have pygame installed
- Run sorting_visualization.py and wait for the pygame window to show up
